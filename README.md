# Dynamical-Stability-Dark-Energy
This repository explores the dynamical stability of dark energy, with a focus on scalar field models (such as quintessence, phantom, and tachyonic fields). The project involves analytical and numerical investigations of cosmological perturbations, phase-space analysis, and stability conditions in different dark energy scenarios.

📌 Key Features
- Phase-space analysis of scalar field dark energy models.
- Stability conditions for different potentials (e.g., exponential, power-law).

Comparison with observational constraints (e.g., Planck data, supernovae, BAO).


🛠️ Requirements
- Python (with numpy, scipy, matplotlib) or Mathematica (if used).
- Cosmology background (Friedmann equations).
